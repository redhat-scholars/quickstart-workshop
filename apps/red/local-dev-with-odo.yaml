  introduction: "Content in the Helm Chart Catalog is defined by HelmChartRepository (HCR) CRs. The HelmChartRepository (HCR) provides a URL, the Helm Catalog is populated by pulling available Helm Charts from each of the HCR URLs.\n- HCRs are cluster scoped. \n- A default HelmChartRepository (HCR) is provided, called the **redhat-helm-repo**.\n- An administrator can add additional HCRs to provide additional Helm Charts."

      Follow these steps to set up a local development loop using `odo`:
      1. Open the [Web Terminal]{{highlight qs-masthead-cloudshell}}

      1. Create a new project namespace named "red-team":
        ```
        oc project red-team
        ```{{execute}}

      1. Clone the example repo:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex
        ```{{execute}}

      1. Change into the repo directory: 
        ```
        cd nodejs-ex
        ```{{execute}}

      1. Generate a new devfile for the repo using the `odo init` command: 
        ```
        odo init --name red-demo-1 --devfile nodejs
        ```{{execute}}

      1. Update the resulting `devfile.yaml`, setting the default port to `8080`: 
        ```
        sed -i devfile.yaml -e "s/targetPort: 3000/targetPort: 8080/"
        ```{{execute}}

      1. Use `odo` to run local sources using remote cluster resources.  Since we only have one terminal, include an "&" after "odo dev" to run it in the background: 
        ```
        odo dev &
        ```{{execute}}

      1. If you were running odo on your laptop, you could connect to the port number listed in the output of `odo dev`.  Since we are using the web terminal, we will need to expose a `svc` in order to check the current state of the app: 
        ```
        oc expose svc/red-demo-1-app
        ```{{execute}}

      1. Open the route url in a new browser tab and read the title of the page: 
        ```
        oc get routes
        ```{{execute}}

      1. Make a small change to the source code (Welcome to Red Hat Summit Connect): 
        ```
        sed -i views/index.html -e 's/your Node.js application on OpenShift/Red Hat Summit Connect 2022/'
        ```{{execute}}

      1. Reload your browser to see the changes
